1. Without a 7-segment plugged into the breadboard, program the
   Arduino with a test script found in this repo.
2. Unplug the Arduino
3. Plug 7-segment into breadboard (refer to picture above for orientation)
4. Plug in Arduino
5. The 7-segment should count from 0000 to 9999 (as, 0000, 1111, 2222,
   etc.)
6. Without unplugging anything, you can upload another test script to
   the Arduino.

Press the reset button on the Arduino if you want to reset the
7-segment (since the reset on the Arduino is wired to the reset on the
7-segment).
